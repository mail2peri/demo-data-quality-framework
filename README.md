## Instructions to run python code
1. Install `pyton`, preferrably python 3.10, if not installed already
    - `https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/`
    - Choose the file based on the `OS`. For example, for macOS, get the macOS installer
2. After installing check whether if python is installed
    - For macOS, `python3 --version` -> `Python 3.10.0` or whichever version is installed
    - For windows, `py --version` -> `Python 3.10.0` or whichever version is installed
3. Create a virtual environment  
    - `python3 -m venv venv` -> you will see a folder called `venv` in the current working directory
4. Activate the virtual environment
    - For macOS, `source venv/bin/activate` -> The virtual environment is created
    - For windows, `cd venv\Scripts` -> `activate`
5. Run the `hello.py` file, and you will see a `Hello, World` output
    - For macOS, `python3 hello.py`
    - For windows, `py hello.py` 
6. That's it âœ…
